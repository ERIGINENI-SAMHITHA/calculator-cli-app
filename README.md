Simple CLI Calculator App using Python
Calculator CLI App

This is a simple calculator that runs in the command line (terminal) and helps you perform basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It was built using Python.

What It Can Do:
Add two numbers
Subtract one number from another
Multiply two numbers
Divide one number by another (with protection against dividing by zero)
Run continuously until the user decides to exit
Handle invalid input (like entering letters instead of numbers)

What I Learned / Used:
While creating this calculator, I practiced:
Writing functions to separate logic for each operation
Using loops to repeat actions until the user exits
Using if-else conditions to handle different choices
Taking input and giving output through the command line
